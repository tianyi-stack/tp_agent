Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) — Euler–Lagrange Verification

Task:
- Verify the Euler–Lagrange equation for the SHO with L = (1/2)·ẋ^2 − (1/2)·x^2.
- Use the python_exec tool with SymPy to symbolically compute the EL equation.
- Confirm the result is ẍ + x = 0 and print "OK_EL" when successful.

Constraints:
- Keep the code minimal and readable.
- Only print concise outputs relevant to the check.
