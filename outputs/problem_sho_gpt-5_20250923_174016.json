The system experiences both harmonic and anharmonic restoring forces, with a potential energy given by:\n\n$$V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \\frac{\\alpha}{4}x^4$$\n\nwhere $k = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1}$ N/m is the linear spring constant and $\\alpha = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}$ N/m³ is a small anharmonic parameter ($\\alpha \\ll k$). The particle is also subject to a time-dependent external driving force:\n\n$$F_{ext}(t) = F_0 \\cos(\\omega_d t)$$\n\nwhere $F_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}$ N and the driving frequency $\\omega_d = 0.9\\omega_0$ (slightly below the natural frequency $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{k/m}$).\n\nThe system starts from rest at $t = 0$ with an initial displacement $x_0 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-11}$ m.\n\nUsing the Lagrangian formalism and Euler-Lagrange equations, followed by perturbation theory for the anharmonic correction, **determine the steady-state amplitude of oscillation** after transient effects have died out, and **calculate the first-order frequency correction** due to the anharmonic term for small amplitude oscillations.\n\nExpress your final answers in the form:\n- Steady-state amplitude: $A_{steady} = $ [numerical value] m\n- Frequency correction: $\\Delta \\omega = $ [analytical expression] rad/s\n\nGiven physical constants: $\\hbar = 1.055 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s"
