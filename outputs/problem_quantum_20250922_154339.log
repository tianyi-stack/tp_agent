[1] Role: llm
    Say: Problem: Quantum Mechanics — Verify [x, p] = iℏ

Task:
- Verify the canonical commutation relation [x, p] = iℏ using a finite-dimensional matrix representation.
- Use the mathematica_exec tool to construct ladder operators a, a†, then x and p.
- Compute the commutator x p − p x and compare with iℏ·I.
- Assert the norm of the difference is below a small tolerance (e.g., 1e-10) and print "OK_QUANTUM" when successful.

Constraints:
- Keep the code minimal and readable.
- Only print concise outputs relevant to the check.

    Code:
        (* Define ladder operators for a finite-dimensional Hilbert space *)
        n = 10; (* Dimension of the space *)
        a = SparseArray[{Band[{2, 1}] -> Sqrt[Range[n - 1]]}, {n, n}];
        ad = Transpose[a];
        
        (* Define position and momentum operators *)
        x = (a + ad)/Sqrt[2];
        p = I (ad - a)/Sqrt[2];
        
        (* Compute the commutator [x, p] *)
        commutator = x.p - p.x;
        
        (* Compare with iℏ·I *)
        hbar = 1; (* Set ℏ = 1 for simplicity *)
        identity = IdentityMatrix[n];
        difference = commutator - I hbar identity;
        
        (* Check the norm of the difference *)
        normDifference = Norm[difference, "Frobenius"];
        If[normDifference < 1.0*^-10, Print["OK_QUANTUM"]]
