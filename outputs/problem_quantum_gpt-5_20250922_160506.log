[1] Role: llm
    Say: Problem: Quantum Mechanics — Verify [x, p] = iℏ

Task:
- Verify the canonical commutation relation [x, p] = iℏ using a finite-dimensional matrix representation.
- Use the mathematica_exec tool to construct ladder operators a, a†, then x and p.
- Compute the commutator x p − p x and compare with iℏ·I.
- Assert the norm of the difference is below a small tolerance (e.g., 1e-10) and print "OK_QUANTUM" when successful.

Constraints:
- Keep the code minimal and readable.
- Only print concise outputs relevant to the check.
