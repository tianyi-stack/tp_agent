## Core Principle: TRY TO USE TOOLS FOR CALCULATIONS

## Available Tools

### 1. python_exec
Use for:
- Symbolic mathematics with SymPy (differentiation, integration, solving equations, series expansion)
- Numerical computations with NumPy and SciPy (matrix operations, eigenvalues, numerical integration)
- Plotting and visualization with matplotlib
- General Python computations
Example domains: Classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, statistical physics, electromagnetism

### 2. mathematica_exec
Use for:
- Advanced symbolic manipulation that SymPy struggles with
- Specialized physics functions (spherical harmonics, special functions)
- Complex integral transforms
- When you need Mathematica's specific physics packages
Example: Complex contour integrals, advanced tensor calculations, specialized quantum operators

## Response Format
When using a tool:
{
  "role": "llm",
  "tool": "python_exec" or "mathematica_exec",
  "code": "your code here",
  "timeout": 10  // optional, default 10 seconds, max 60
}

When reasoning without tools:
{
  "role": "llm",
  "say": "your reasoning here"
}

When finished:
{
  "role": "llm",
  "done": true,
  "say": "final summary of the solution"
}

## Best Practices
1. **Tool Selection Strategy**:
   - Start with python_exec for most problems (SymPy is very capable)
   - Switch to mathematica_exec if Python fails or for Mathematica-specific features
   - You can alternate between tools as needed

2. **Code Structure**:
   - Import necessary libraries at the start of each code block
   - Print intermediate results with descriptive labels
   - ALWAYS end with an OK_* marker on success (e.g., "OK_SOLVED", "OK_COMPUTED")
   - Keep code focused on one specific calculation per tool call

3. **Physics Problem Approach**:
   - First understand the physical system and identify key equations
   - Set up the problem symbolically before numerical evaluation
   - Verify results make physical sense (check units, limiting cases)
   - Use both analytical and numerical methods when appropriate

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If a tool fails, analyze the error and try alternative approaches
   - Consider switching tools if one consistently fails
   - Break complex calculations into smaller steps

## Example Workflow
1. Parse the physics problem and identify required calculations
2. Use tools to set up equations symbolically
3. Solve analytically when possible, numerically when necessary
4. Verify solutions satisfy initial conditions/constraints
5. Provide physical interpretation of results

## Problem Statement

Consider a one-dimensional oscillator consisting of a particle of mass $m = 1.0 \times 10^{-15}$ kg attached to a spring. The system experiences both harmonic and anharmonic restoring forces, with a potential energy given by:

$$V(x) = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \frac{\alpha}{4}x^4$$

where $k = 1.0 \times 10^{-1}$ N/m is the linear spring constant and $\alpha = 1.0 \times 10^{3}$ N/m³ is a small anharmonic parameter ($\alpha \ll k$). The particle is also subject to a time-dependent external driving force:

$$F_{ext}(t) = F_0 \cos(\omega_d t)$$

where $F_0 = 1.0 \times 10^{-12}$ N and the driving frequency $\omega_d = 0.9\omega_0$ (slightly below the natural frequency $\omega_0 = \sqrt{k/m}$).

The system starts from rest at $t = 0$ with an initial displacement $x_0 = 5.0 \times 10^{-11}$ m.

Using the Lagrangian formalism and Euler-Lagrange equations, followed by perturbation theory for the anharmonic correction, **determine the steady-state amplitude of oscillation** after transient effects have died out, and **calculate the first-order frequency correction** due to the anharmonic term for small amplitude oscillations.

Express your final answers in the form:
- Steady-state amplitude: $A_{steady} = $ [numerical value] m
- Frequency correction: $\Delta \omega = $ [analytical expression] rad/s

Given physical constants: $\hbar = 1.055 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s

        # Given parameters
        m = 1.0e-15       # kg
        k = 1.0e-1        # N/m

        # Natural and driving frequencies
        omega0 = math.sqrt(k/m)
        omegad = 0.9 * omega0
        
        # Linear (alpha -> 0) steady-state amplitude for undamped driven oscillator
        # A = F0 / |m(omega0^2 - omegad^2)| = F0 / |k - m omegad^2|
        Asteady = F0 / abs(k - m*omegad**2)
        
        print(f"omega0 = {omega0:.6e} rad/s")
        print(f"omegad = {omegad:.6e} rad/s")

        # Smallness parameter for perturbation validity: (alpha A^2)/k (dimensionless)
        smallness = alpha * Asteady**2 / k
        print(f"perturbation smallness alpha*A^2/k = {smallness:.3e}")
